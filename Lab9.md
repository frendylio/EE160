# Lab 9
Lab 8 Due tonight at midnight. 

## switch case
- This is essentially a different method of writing if statements
- MUST HAVE `break;` after every case.

Example:
```c
int var;

switch(var) {
  case 1:
    break;
  case 2:
    break;
  case 3:
    break;
  case 4:
    break;
  case 5:
  case 6:
    break;
    
  default:
    break; //optional
}
```
This is equivalent to:
```c
int var;

if(var == 1) {
  //case 1
} else if(var == 2) {
  //case 2
} else if(var == 3) {
  //case 3
} else if(var == 4) {
  //case 4
} else if(var == 5 || var == 6) {
  //case 5 OR 6
} else {
  //default
}
```
- a switch case is used for one variable so you can't really do an "&&" (AND) operator because the same variable cannot equal two different things.
  - If you want to have a "&&" with two variables, you can just put an if statement inside the case.
Example:
```c
int a = 1;
int b = 2;

switch(a) {
  case 1:
    if(b == 2)
      //some code
    break;
  case 2:
    break;
}
```
